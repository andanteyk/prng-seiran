# `seiran` pseudorandom number generator

[Japanese version is here. / Êó•Êú¨Ë™û„ÅØ„Åì„Å°„Çâ](README-ja.md)

I introduce some new LFSR-based pseudorandom number generators.

## Minimal Implementation (C)

```c
uint64_t rotl(uint64_t x, int k) { return (x << k) | (x >> (-k & 63)); }
// State must be initialized with any value except {0, 0}
uint64_t next(uint64_t state[2]) {
	uint64_t s0 = state[0], s1 = state[1];
	uint64_t result = rotl((s0 + s1) * 9, 29) + s0;
	state[0] = s0 ^ rotl(s1, 29);
	state[1] = s0 ^ s1 << 9;
	return result;
}
```

For more details, see `seiran128.c`.

## Pros

1. It is fast in 64-bit environment.
	* About 3.7 times faster than Mersenne Twister(64-bit version).
1. It is portable and easy to implement.
	* It does not use environment / language dependent instructions such as 128 bit multiplication.
1. Its period is 2^128 - 1, which is mathematically provable.
	* It is sufficient for games and simulations.
1. The output is 1-dimensionally equidistributed. All 64-bit integer values are output with almost equal probability.
1. There are no low quality bits in the output.
	* As with LCG, there is no problem that the lower bits have low randomness.
1. It is space efficient.
	* It uses only 128 bits == 16 bytes.
1. It passes many powerful randomness tests.  
	(In the following, "rev" represents the output bit order reversed, and "std" represents the output as it is.)
	* [PractRand](http://pracrand.sourceforge.net/) v0.94 expanded extra ( `-tf 2 -te 1` ) 32TB: no anomalies in 2417 test result(s)
	* [Hamming-weight dependencies](http://prng.di.unimi.it/hwd.php) 1PB: p = 0.581
	* [TestU01](http://simul.iro.umontreal.ca/testu01/tu01.html) v.1.2.3 BigCrush std/rev: In all tests, p are in [1e-10, 1 - 1e-10]
	* [gjrand](http://gjrand.sourceforge.net/) v4.2.1.0
		* testunif 10T ( `--ten-tera` ): p = std 0.369 / rev 0.276
		* testfunif 1T ( `--tera` ): p = std 0.574 / rev 0.145
1. It has a jump function available. It makes it easy to parallel execution.
	* An operation equivalent to 2^64 `next()` calls can be performed in constant time.
	* It provides 2^64 non-overlapping sequences of length 2^64.

## Cons

1. It is not cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator.
	* MUST NOT use for cryptographic purposes.
	* I tried to restore the internal state from 3 consecutive raw 64-bit outputs using [Z3 solver](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3), and succeeded in a few minutes.
1. There are no variants that use 32 bit words.
1. Because it is new, it has not been investigated by others.

[Harness used in xoshiro/xoroshiro](http://xoshiro.di.unimi.it/harness.c) was used for speed measurement. The measurement environment is `Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700HQ CPU @ 2.80GHz / gcc 7.3.0`.  
The speed may vary depending on the environment and circumstances.
